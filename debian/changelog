polonius (0.7.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Makefile: automatic source dependency tracking for rebuilds
  * Bug fix: do not 'process special chars' in file reads, only when
    adding instructions
  * Replaced old test suite with new, more robust one written in Bash++

polonius (0.7.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The dream of instruction optimization has finally arrived!
    The -O option allows you to specify the optimization level for
    your instructions in polonius-editor. -O0 disables optimizations,
    -O1 applies theorems 0 and 1 as outlined in the wiki page
    detailing the mathematics, and -O2 applies theorems 0, 1, 3 and 4.
    -O2 is the default unless otherwise specified.
    At the moment, the instruction sequence is optimized before
    execution, however, the File insert and remove functions have not
    been modified to execute multiple operations in a single pass
    of the file yet. This will be done very soon.
    See https://github.com/rail5/polonius/wiki/Instruction-Optimization
    for more information on how this is done.

polonius (0.6.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Do not reset search mode on -f
    Previously, -f set search mode to 'normal'
    This would mean that if a search command was entered with -e
    preceding -f, the search mode would be reset to normal from regex
    mode. This would be incorrect behavior

polonius (0.6.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Merge pull request #37 from rail5/total-rewrite
    The editor and reader have been completely re-written
    from scratch.
    This closes #23 and #16
  * Use all CPU cores for builds unless otherwise specified
  * Support for the 'end' keyword has been removed

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Mon, 02 Jun 2025 16:44:52 +0800

polonius (0.5.16) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Super hacky fix for a bug inserting to files of 0 size
    A TOTAL rewrite of both the editor and the reader is coming
    very, very, very, very soon

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Thu, 29 May 2025 16:44:06 +0800

polonius (0.5.15) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Improved help messages Much better formatting
  * Patched a bug in compilation on Ubuntu

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Wed, 12 Feb 2025 11:08:04 +0800

polonius (0.5.14) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added -f option to polonius-editor
    The -f option allows the user to specify a FILE which contains our
    instruction sequences, rather than specifying those instructions
    via the command line.
    E.g.: polonius-editor ./text.txt -f ./instructions.txt
  * Patched another bug found by the test suite in which Polonius
    couldn't handle blank lines in instruction sequences

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sat, 07 Sep 2024 11:15:00 +0800

polonius (0.5.13) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Polonius can now accept single-line 'delimited' instructions
    Multiple instructions of the same type can now be given on a single
    line in the format: INSERT 0 abc; 10 def; 20 ghi
    Or: REPLACE 0 abc; 10 def; 20 ghi
    Or: REMOVE 0 2; 10 12; 20 22
    Literal semicolons can also be inserted by escaping the semicolon
    with a backslash, as in:
    INSERT 10 along the wall to keep\; and slept
  * 'Instruction sets' have been renamed to the more appropriate
    'Instruction sequences'
    This gives a clearer idea of what they are
  * Added loads more tests
  * Patched another small bug found by the tests

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Fri, 06 Sep 2024 19:08:22 +0800

polonius (0.5.12) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added infrastructure to run automated tests on changes to Polonius
    These will help to make sure that functionality isn't broken by any
    code changes.
  * Patched a small bug in INSERT which was found by this new automated
    testing infrastructure

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Fri, 06 Sep 2024 12:30:19 +0800

polonius (0.5.11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Use the program_name variable instead of hard-coding the name into
    error messages
  * Make sure that the user provides instructions to execute
  * Refuse to create a new file if the instruction sequence is invalid.
    If we're creating a new file, the first instruction should be an
    INSERT
  * Immediately write a newline char when creating a new file

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Thu, 05 Sep 2024 12:58:55 +0800

polonius (0.5.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Emergency patch
    Patching a bug that I carelessly introduced earlier
    There's a reason that the current version number < 1
  * Added more helpful error messages to invalid instruction errors

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Wed, 04 Sep 2024 22:25:40 +0800

polonius (0.5.9) stable; urgency=medium

  * Moved from std::regex to boost::regex. This finally closes #29
  * Removed unfinished cli build from make target 'all'

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Wed, 04 Sep 2024 11:26:25 +0800

polonius (0.5.8) stable; urgency=medium

  * More sanity checks on block size inputs
    Block sizes are now stored as 64-bit integers, and there are more
    checks in place to ensure valid input. This closes #30
  * Fixed problem with stack overflows in regex searches
    The standard library's regex search function is recursive and has
    potential to overflow the stack, particularly when searching very
    large documents (in fact the *point* of polonius) This was documented
    before it was fully understood in Github issue #29
    To fix it, polonius-reader is now compiled with -fsplit-stack.
    This option allows a discontiguous stack which grows automatically
    as needed

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Tue, 03 Sep 2024 17:00:31 +0800

polonius (0.5.7) stable; urgency=medium

  * Patched a bug with 'remove' instructions
    Previously, remove instructions didn't work properly with the 'end'
    keyword. That has now been fixed in this change. This closes #26

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Tue, 03 Sep 2024 13:43:26 +0800

polonius (0.5.6) stable; urgency=medium

  * Updated help string -- corrected
  a mistake

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sun, 27 Aug 2023 11:34:17 -0400

polonius (0.5.1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Polonius-reader now exits with
  a non-zero exit code if a search
  was unsuccessful

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Thu, 24 Aug 2023 16:15:04 -0400

polonius (0.5) stable; urgency=medium

  * Polonius-reader is now capable of
  performing regex searches. The fact
  that this is possible is a miracle as
  far as I'm concerned.
  The regex support isn't perfect, and
  may fail from time to time while I'm
  patching out any bugs.
  A regex search can be performed by
  passing the -e option when doing a
  search.
  With this addition, I believe that
  polonius-reader and polonius-editor
  are essentially feature-complete.

polonius (0.4.10) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * Patched a small bug in the 'end' keyword
  which allowed for 'replace' instructions
  with start positions lower than zero

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Fri, 18 Aug 2023 12:21:03 -0400

polonius (0.4.9) bullseye; urgency=medium

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Thu, 17 Aug 2023 21:30:11 -0400

polonius (0.4.8) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * Added 'end' keyword. This
  keyword can be used in instructions
  in place of absolute positions
  and always refers to the end of
  the file. e.g.: 'INSERT end hello'

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Thu, 17 Aug 2023 18:56:21 -0400

polonius (0.4.7) bullseye; urgency=medium

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Tue, 15 Aug 2023 23:19:51 -0400

polonius (0.4.6) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * Patched a bug which caused end positions
  reported by --output-pos to be off by 1

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sat, 22 Apr 2023 21:16:15 -0400

polonius (0.4.2) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * Changed delimiter in polonius-reader from commas to
  spaces in order to match the delimiters in polonius-editor

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sat, 22 Apr 2023 18:30:02 -0400

  Added blocksize support to polonius-reader.
  Updated manual pages

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sun, 09 Apr 2023 20:16:11 -0400

polonius (0.3) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * Patched a bug which prevented polonius-editor
  from obtaining file descriptors on files larger
  than 2GB when running on 32-bit systems
  Previously, this bug caused a segfault on
  trying to open large files on 32-bit systems

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Tue, 04 Apr 2023 22:57:03 -0400

polonius (0.2) bullseye; urgency=medium

polonius (0.1) bullseye; urgency=low

  * Initial release
  polonius-reader and polonius-editor
  are functional, however the editor
  does not yet support Multi-Byte
